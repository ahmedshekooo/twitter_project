# 🐶 Twitter Data Wrangling & Analysis: WeRateDogs

This project focuses on wrangling, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing Twitter data from the [WeRateDogs™](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) account. It follows the data wrangling process taught in the [Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

## 🧾 Project Summary

The project uses data from three different sources:

1. **Twitter Archive** – a CSV file of basic tweet data
2. **Image Predictions** – provided by Udacity via a neural network classifier
3. **Tweet JSON data** – programmatically gathered from the Twitter API

The datasets are cleaned, merged, and analyzed to uncover insights about dog breeds, ratings, and social engagement.

## 🧹 Wrangling Steps

The wrangling process follows these stages:

1. **Gathering** data from multiple sources
2. **Assessing** data for quality and tidiness issues (both visually and programmatically)
3. **Cleaning** data using defined rules
4. **Storing** cleaned data in a master DataFrame
5. **Analyzing and visualizing** to derive insights
